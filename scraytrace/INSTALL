Follow these instructions if not installed from Solarsoft.

1) Make sure that the Solar Corona Raytrace package is installed: scort-X.Y.tar.gz, and locate the libraytrace.so shared library: it contains the C routines for the LOS integration and various models.

2) Expand the tar.gz or copy the files of the rtwl distribution in your IDL source tree.

3) Go to the lib subdirectory of the IDL procedure distribution.
> cd .../your_IDL_source_raytrace_directory/lib

4) Copy the libraytrace.so file or make a symbolic link to it.
> cp .../your_libraytrace_file_directory/libraytrace.so .
or
> ln -s .../your_libraytrace_file_directory/libraytrace.so

5) Under the IDL prompt, run rttest. If the tests are successful, the installation is successful.
IDL> rttest
