1) What's Docbook ?
Like latex, it's a way to generate documents. It's oriented for technical and software documentation. The source file is formated in XML. The definition of the markup tags are given by the Docbook standard. From the source file, it's supposedly possible to generate the documentation in different format such as html, pdf, ps, rtf.

For more info you can check:
http://www.docbook.org/
http://www.docbook.org/tdg/en/html/docbook.html
http://docbook.sourceforge.net/

2) Generate the html doc.
Go to the directory where the raytraceman.docbook.xml and this REAME are and just do make.

shell> make

Note that you might need to edit the Makefile.

Required programs:
- xsltproc, xmlto: programs that come from libxml2 package:
http://xmlsoft.org/index.html
- latex
- dvi2bitmap


3) Release of the html doc on the net.
For the moment it is available there:

It's also password protected for the moment: ask me (arnaud) if you need the login/password.


4) Generate the pdf formated doc
I still have to deal with that. It shouldn't be too much of a hassle but I've got an error when I try to use xmlto pdf. Still need to fix that.
